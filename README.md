# 🌍 Energy Consumption & Emission Analysis (SQL)

### 📘 Project Overview
This SQL-based analysis investigates how **global emissions, GDP, and population** interact over time.  
The goal is to evaluate sustainability patterns and identify the countries contributing most to global emissions.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Skills:** SQL Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries, Indexing, Query Optimization

---

### ⚙️ Steps & Approach
1. **Data Integration:**  
   - Combined data from 6 relational tables (emission, GDP, population, etc.) **comprising 1,300+ records**.  
   - Established relationships via country and year keys.

2. **Data Analysis:**  
   - Queried total and average emissions by country and year.  
   - Calculated emission-to-GDP and energy consumption per capita ratios.  
   - Tracked emission trends from 2020–2024.

3. **Performance Optimization:**  
   - Implemented indexing and filtering to improve query efficiency.  
   - Used subqueries and aggregate functions for precise comparisons.

### 📊 Key Insights
- Top 10 most populated countries contributed the largest emission share.  
- Some countries improved per-capita emission performance despite GDP growth.  
- Trend analysis revealed gradual emission reduction in several regions post-2020.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Enhanced SQL proficiency with multi-table joins and conditional logic.  
- Improved ability to translate analytical questions into SQL queries.  
- Learned to measure environmental and economic relationships using data.
